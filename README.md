Basic Excel spreadsheet
Implement a basic spreadsheet which will have the following functionality:
● The excel sheet should have m x n cells in the sheet.
● Should have ability to add/remove rows or columns to/from the existing sheet.
● Clicking on each cell should make it editable and clicking anywhere else should switch it back to a read-only mode.
● Should have the ability to sort data.
● Build a cut/copy/paste functionality over the spreadsheet.
● Avoid using JS libraries or frameworks. eg. jQuery. Vanilla JS is preferred.
● Object-oriented JS code is a plus!
● Please use client-side storage for storing the data and do not worry about an API for it.
