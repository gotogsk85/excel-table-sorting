Basic Excel spreadsheet<br />
Implement a basic spreadsheet which will have the following functionality:<br />
● The excel sheet should have m x n cells in the sheet. <br />
● Should have ability to add/remove rows or columns to/from the existing sheet.<br />
● Clicking on each cell should make it editable and clicking anywhere else should switch it back to a read-only mode.<br />
● Should have the ability to sort data.<br />
● Build a cut/copy/paste functionality over the spreadsheet.<br />
● Avoid using JS libraries or frameworks. eg. jQuery. Vanilla JS is preferred.<br />
● Object-oriented JS code is a plus!<br />
● Please use client-side storage for storing the data and do not worry about an API for it.<br />
